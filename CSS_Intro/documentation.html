-----WHAT IS CSS????
        * css stand for "cascading style sheets"
        * css uses cascading algorithm to  style the sheet.
        * css is used in html to style the page.
        * css is used by using style attributes of html.
        * one valid css style or instruction ends with semi colon.
        * there are three ways by which we can apply css
            1) Inline css.
            2) Internal css.
            3) External css.
        * one should never ever do inline css and should avoid internal css as much as possible.
        * The css that is written later will be used for styling the sheet i.e. if more than one css code is styling the same 
          html element then the css code written later will be given preference.
                ex: 
                    <style>
                        span{
                            font-size: 20px;
                        }
                        h2{
                            color:blue;
                        }
                        </style>
                        </head>
                        <link rel="stylesheet" href="Style.css">

                   -> In the above example h2 element is being applied css to change the color to blue in the internal css
                      but in external css which is Style.css file h2 element is given css of color: gold
                      Since external css is applied later hence h2 element color will be changed to gold.
    
------ WHAT IS INLINE CSS????
        * Inline css means if there is an HTML element i.e. all the html element like h1, div, span etc. have special attribute 
          name style where we can write a bunch of css.
        * Inline css can be applied by using style attribute of an html element.
        * For ex. 
                <h2 style="color:gold; font=50px;"> Rahul singh </h2>.
        * Inline css is not so good because when we write a lot of css then the html page
           will not look that much good.
        * hence Internal css is used.

----- WHAT IS INTERNAL CSS????
        * Internal css is used within the head tag of html document.
        * This way of applying css is used to style a particular html tag.
        * For ex:
                <head>
                    <meta charset="UTF-8">
                    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
                    <title>Document</title>
                    <style>
                        span{
                            font-size: 20px;
                        }
                    </style>
                </head>
        * this way of styling the html page is called internal because within the same page css
          being used.
        * Reasons why internal css is not preffered over external css??
                -> There is the concept called "Separation of Concern" which says that in relevant file there should only be relevant code. 
                   i.e. if there is html element in one file then that file should only contain html element to design the webpage.
                        css code must be written in the separate file.

---- WHAT IS EXTERNAL CSS?
        * Extenal css is called external because the css is written in the other document.
        * The html document in which css is to be applied has to be linked to this css file using link tag
        * For ex.
                <link rel="stylesheet" href="Style.css">

---- CSS ATTRIBUTES TO STYLE THE SHEET
            * color:
                -> this color properties of css is used to provide color to the html element.
                -> to impart color to the html element we can use the following properties
                     ... directly specify the color name i.e. color=gold;
                     ... specify the hexadecimal code of the color i.e. color = #00000000;
                     ... specify the rgb combination of the color i.e. color = rgb(100,100,100);

            * font-size: 
                -> this attribute is used to change size of font of the html element.

            *
