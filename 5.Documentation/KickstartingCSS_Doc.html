------RESOURCES TO BE USED FOR CSS?***********************************************
        * 1) color.adobe.com/explore -> to check color combination i.e. which color combination will look good together.
          2) fontpair.co/all         -> to check the differnt kind of fonts that we can use for our website.
          3) these website are used to read the documentation of css     -> css-tricks.com    
                                                                         -> mdn css article 
          
-----WHAT IS CSS????***************************************************************
        * css stand for "cascading style sheets"
        * css uses cascading algorithm to  style the sheet.
            -> if we are applying styling to an html element and there are more than one code pointers which are styling the element
               then which styling will be given the precedence is decided by cascading algorithm.
        * css is used in html to style the page.
        * one valid css style or instruction ends with semi colon.
        * there are three ways by which we can apply css
            1) Inline css.
            2) Internal css.
            3) External css.
        * one should never ever do inline css and should avoid internal css as much as possible.
        * The css that is written later will be used for styling the sheet i.e. if more than one css code is styling the same 
          html element then the css code written later will be given preference.
                ex: 
                    <style>
                        span{
                            font-size: 20px;
                        }
                        h2{
                            color:blue;
                        }
                        </style>
                        </head>
                        <link rel="stylesheet" href="Style.css">

                   -> In the above example h2 element is being applied css to change the color to blue in the internal css
                      but in external css which is Style.css file h2 element is given css of color: gold
                      Since external css is applied later hence h2 element color will be changed to gold.
    
------ WHAT IS INLINE CSS????******************************************************
        * Inline css means if there is an HTML element i.e. all the html element like h1, div, span etc. have special attribute 
          named "style" where we can write a bunch of css.
        * Inline css can be applied by using "style" attribute of an html element.
        * One valid styling of inline css ends with semi-colon.
        * For ex. 
                <h2 style="color:gold; font=50px;"> Rahul singh </h2>.
        * Inline css is not so good because when we write a lot of css then the html page
           will not look that much good.
        * hence Internal css is used.

----- WHAT IS INTERNAL CSS????****************************************************
        * Internal css is used within the head tag of html document.
        * This way of applying css is used to style a particular html tag.
        * For ex:
                <head>
                    <meta charset="UTF-8">
                    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
                    <title>Document</title>
                    <style>
                        span{
                            font-size: 20px;
                        }
                    </style>
                </head>
        * this way of styling the html page is called internal because within the same page css
          being used.
        * Reasons why internal css is not preffered over external css??
                -> There is the concept called "Separation of Concern" which says that in relevant file there should only be relevant code. 
                   i.e. if there is html element in one file then that file should only contain html element to design the webpage.
                        css code must be written in the separate file.

---- WHAT IS EXTERNAL CSS?********************************************************
        * Extenal css is called external because the css is written in the other document.
        * The html document in which css is to be applied has to be linked to this css file using link tag
        * For ex.
                <link rel="stylesheet" href="Style.css">


---- SELECTORS???*******************************************************************
        * Selectors is a mechanism which css provide us to collectively select a bunch of html elements together
          and style them together.
        * There are different types of selectors based on which type of html elements it select.
        
        1) UNIVERSAL SELECTORS.
                -> this selectors select everything in the html document and apply css rule to everything.
                -> this selector select every html tag manually and apply styling to it.
                -> represented by *
                -> ex:
                    * {
                        background-color:blue;
                    }
    
        2) TYPE SELECTOR:
                -> this selector select a particular html element and then apply styling to it.
                -> ex:
                    h2{
                        background-color: blue;
                    }
        
        3) CLASS SELECTOR:
                -> class selector says that all the element with corresponding given class attribute will be selected.
                -> Syntax:
                        .(class name){
                        }
                -> ex:
                        .mid-text{
                            background-color:red;
                        }
        
        4) ID SELECTOR:
                -> this selector selects the element with particular id attribute and apply styling to it.
                -> Syntax:
                        #(id-attribute-name){
                        }
                -> Ex:
                        #head-text{
                            text-decoration-line:underline;
                            text-decoration-style:wavy;
                        }

        5) ATTRIBUTE SELECTOR:
                -> this selector selects all the html element having the mentioned attribute and apply styling to it.
                -> syntax: 

        
        6) SELECTOR LIST:
                -> agar aap ek se jyada html element pe same styling apply karna chahte hai to ek saath bhi kar sake hai
                -> for ex. agar mai div tag and h2 tag dono html element pe same styling apply karna chahta hun to 
                       mai , ka use karke kar sakta hun jaisa ki neeche diya gya hai.

                       div,h2{
                            font-size:larger;
                       }

        7) COMBINATORS:
                
                7.1) DESCENDANT COMBINATOR:
                    -> The descendant combinator — typically represented by a single space (" ") character — combines two selectors 
                       such that elements matched by the second selector are selected if they have an ancestor 
                       (parent, parent's parent, parent's parent's parent, etc.) element matching the first selector.
                    -> for ex:
                            A B{
                                color: white;
                            }
                            all the html element B which is the descendant of A will be selected and styling will be applied to it only.

                7.2) CHILD COMBINATOR:                
                    -> The child combinator (>) is placed between two CSS selectors. It matches only those elements matched by the second selector 
                       that are the direct children of elements matched by the first. Descendant elements further down the hierarchy don't match.
                       For example, to select only <p> elements that are direct children of <article> elements:
                        article > p{

                        }
                
                7.3) NEXT-SIBLING COMBINATOR / ADJACENT-SIBLING COMBINATOR:
                    -> The next-sibling combinator (+) is placed between two CSS selectors. It matches only those elements matched by the second 
                       selector that are the next sibling element of the first selector. For example, to select all <img> elements that are 
                       immediately preceded by a <p> element:
                        p + img{
                        }
                
                7.4) GENRAL SIBLINGS COMBINATOR:
                    -> If you want to select siblings of an element even if they are not directly adjacent, then you can use the subsequent-sibling 
                    combinator (~). To select all <img> elements that come anywhere after <p> elements, we'd do this:
                        p ~ img{
                        }
                
        8) PSEUDO CLASSES AND PSEUDO ELEMENTS:
            -> If you want to make some changes to the selected html element based on some event.
               for ex: if you are hovering over to an element then you want to make some changes.
               In this case pseudo classes and pseudo elements are used.
            
            8.1) PSEUDO CLASSES
                    -> represented by : 
                    -> for ex: 
                       a :hover{
                            text-decoration:none;
                       }
                       what this example is saying that whenever we hover over anchor tag then the underline should go away.
                       hover class is not actually present in the html doc.

                    8.1.1) :visited pseudo class
                    8.1.2) :hover pseudo class
            
            8.2) PSEUDO ELEMENTS:
                    -> represented by ::
                    -> pseudo elements are the html elements that are not actually present in the html doc.
